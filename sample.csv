Introduction to ML,JavaTpoint,Machine Learning is a subset of Artificial Intelligence that provides systems the ability to automatically learn and improve from experience.
Supervised Learning,GeeksForGeeks,In supervised learning, the machine is trained using labeled data. It learns a mapping from inputs to outputs based on this data.
Unsupervised Learning,JavaTpoint,Unsupervised learning involves training without labeled data, identifying patterns and groupings within the input data.
Reinforcement Learning,ML_docs_book,Reinforcement Learning trains agents to take actions to maximize cumulative rewards in an environment based on feedback.
Applications of ML,GeeksForGeeks,Applications of Machine Learning include recommendation systems, image recognition, speech recognition, and autonomous vehicles.
